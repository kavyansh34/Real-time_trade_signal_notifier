# Trading-indicator-EMA-7-25
This is an trading indicator which is a impactful solution for trader saving their time and efforts. This indicator actually sends alerts when strategy gets activated in real time market with execution price, trading SL and trading TP.
This strategy is applicable in volatile market and work when liquidity in pretty much good and it iss tested on BITCOIN, TRUMP COIN and other meme coins as well on shorter time frame as well as bigger time frames.
I have analysed that the when EMA 7 is below the EMA 25 and and candle closes above the EMA 25, we can place a long trade with taking closing candle's low as SL and Risk to Reward ratio of 1:3. The condition is same with the short position. In short trades, EMA 7 must be above the EMA 25 and if candle closes below the EMA 25 the taking breaking candle's high as SL, we can trade a short position with 1:3 Risk to Reward ratio.
