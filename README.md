## Implemented strategy  
I have analysed that the when EMA 7 is below the EMA 25 and and candle closes above the EMA 25, we can place a long trade with taking closing candle's low as SL and Risk to Reward ratio of 1:3. The condition is same with the short position. In short trades, EMA 7 must be above the EMA 25 and if candle closes below the EMA 25 the taking breaking candle's high as SL, we can trade a short position with 1:3 Risk to Reward ratio.
